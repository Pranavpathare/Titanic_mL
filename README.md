The following repository contains the Titanic Data Analysis Project work done on it as a part of the Project assigned to us by the AI Club of college.
- Titanic_ml contains all the data analysis and model fitting 
- Three other files - 
  1. Knn.ipynb
  2. LogisticRegression.ipynb 
  3. LinearRegression.ipynb 
include models I have trained from scratch using plain numpy and matplotlib.Two of these have also been included in the titanic_ml notebook.

Thank you
